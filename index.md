## Evolutive sudoku

A project to understand the concepts of evolutionary algorithms using the sudoku as study case

This project is based in one I did in german, what is ... well ... not very usefull for the non german speaker world but I did it while I was in the TU Ilmenau, a german university in Thuringen, and I wanted to practice mi german :D. If the german version is usefull for you or you are just curious, the original code in german is available in:
[Evolutive Sudoku Deutsch](http://sebasgverde.github.io/EvolutiveSudokuDeutsch/)

The program has inplementations of:
- Selection Methods
- Crossover Methods
- Mutation Methods
- Dynamic parameters
- Local Maximum Strategies
